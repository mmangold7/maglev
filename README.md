Magnetic levitation project. The idea is to float a permanent magnet underneath another permanent magnet and an electromagnet all along the same axis. The top permanent magnet provides most of the force and the electromagnet stabilizes the equalibrium between the magnets and gravity with the help of an arduino and a hall effect sensor which provides a signal to use for proportional current control in the electromagnet. Will probably implement full PID at some point.
